Clients API exposes endpoints that allow users to create, list, update and delete webhooks.
to get terminology straight; a Webhook is an HTTP request, triggered by an event in CoinPayments API and sent to a 
merchant api to notify them about events specified by the merchant. 
in other words they are automatically sent out when their event is fired in CoinPayments API.
