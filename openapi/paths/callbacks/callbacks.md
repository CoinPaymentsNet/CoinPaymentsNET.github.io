A callback address is a dynamically generated payment address that can be used by the payee to receive payments at any time.
The payer can initiate a payment by sending the specified amount to the callback address, which will trigger a notification to the payee ( if payee has webhook integration with CoinPayments API ). 
This allows for more flexibility and convenience compared to the traditional invoice-based payment process.
