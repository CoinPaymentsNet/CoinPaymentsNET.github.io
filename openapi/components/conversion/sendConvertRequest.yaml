  amountInSmallestUnits:
    description: |
      refers to the amount of a specific cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, measured in its smallest divisible unit, AKA atomic units.
      (e.g., Satoshis for Bitcoin).
      It allows for precise and detailed transactions by specifying the amount in the smallest possible denomination.
      This approach enables you to send fractional amounts of the currency accurately.

      When set to true, the receiver of the conversion will pay the fees. In this case,
      the AmountInSmallestUnits will be deducted from the source balance, and the receiver will receive the remaining amount after deducting the fees.
      When set to false (or not provided), the fees will be added to the AmountInSmallestUnits,
      and the total sum (including fees) will be deducted from the source balance.
      The receiver will receive the AmountInSmallestUnits exactly as specified.
