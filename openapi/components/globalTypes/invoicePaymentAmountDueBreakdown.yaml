    description: this parameter represents the monetary value as an integer in the base (smallest) unit of the currency. For instance, Bitcoin can be divided into 8 decimal places,
              with each division known as a Satoshi. Therefore, 1 BTC would have a value of 100,000,000 Satoshis, and 0.00031 BTC would have a value of 31,000 Satoshis. Similarly,
              an amount of $9.99 USD would be represented as 999 cents. In the case of zero-decimal currencies like the Yen, a value of Â¥500 would be represented as 500.
