Welcome to CoinPayments API documentation!

CoinPayments API is mostly RESTful JSON API for interacting with blockchains, 
accessed over HTTP or HTTPS from the domain **https://coinpayments/api/v1**

# Introduction
This API definition is intended to guid you to integrate CoinPayments with your system.

[create-openapi-repo](https://github.com/Redocly/create-openapi-repo) tool
and

the [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/Redoc) documentation engine. Beyond
the standard OpenAPI syntax, we use a few 

[vendor
extensions](https://github.com/Redocly/Redoc/blob/master/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md).

# Objective

The goal of this documentation is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to CoinPayments API which
allows developers to discover and understand the capabilities
of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection.
When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service 
with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interfaces have done for lower-level programming, OpenAPI removes the
guesswork in calling the service.
