    # Common API Errors

    This section provides an overview of the common errors that you may
    encounter when utilizing CoinPayment API. By familiarizing yourself with
    these errors, you will be better equipped to handle potential issues and
    troubleshoot effectively. Understanding these errors will contribute to a
    smoother integration process and ensure a more seamless payment experience
    for your users.


    ### Unauthorized

    This error occurs when an invalid `clientId` or `clientSecret` is used to
    generate API signature to authenticate requests. It may also occur if a
    `clientId` is valid but the integration is either deleted or the user's
    account does not exist. or an invalid or incorrect client secret is
    provided. In such cases, the API returns an "Unauthorized" error.


    ### Insufficient Funds

    This error can occur in different scenarios, such as during withdrawal to an
    external address or when converting a coin to another, whether to an
    internal or external address. It arises when the user's wallet does not have
    enough balance to cover the requested transaction amount.


    ### Invalid Address

    When sending a request to create a withdrawal or a conversion, if the
    provided address is not valid or formatted incorrectly, this error is
    triggered. Users should double-check the address they provided and ensure it
    follows the required format. here are examples of Valid addresses



    #### Valid UTXO-Based Coin Addresses:

    - Bitcoin (BTC): `1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2`

    - Bitcoin Cash (BCH):
    `bitcoincash:qr7uq7uvujmzhcv29tw92q0hs7fwpht4fvl4a4kj9a`

    - Litecoin (LTC): `LZx9pzGfH6mKSzVsJZnryeVrRzt6X8uZ9r`


    #### Valid Token Coin Addresses:

    - Ethereum (ETH): `0x7E5F4552091A69125d5DfCb7b8C2659029395Bdf`

    - ERC-20 Tokens (e.g., DAI, USDT):
    `0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F`



    ### Invalid or Unsupported Currency:

    This error occurs when the requested invoice, withdrawal, conversion
    involves an invalid or unsupported currency. It could be due to the currency
    not being listed or supported on the platform. Users can utilize the
    currencies API included in the documentation to list all supported
    currencies and verify if their intended currency is supported before
    initiating the transaction.


    ### Bad request ( Input validation errors ):

    This error occurs when there are issues with the validation of fields in the
    request's payload. For example, if a required field is not sent, or if the
    fields have invalid values or incorrect types. The API response for a
    validation error includes a description of the error and may provide details
    about the missing fields or the specific issues with the payload.




    # Rate limits

    The API provides access to our platform's data and functionality, but in
    order to maintain the stability and performance of our services, rate limits
    have been implemented. Rate limits are set to prevent excessive use of the
    API and to ensure fair usage among all integrations.

    Currently, the rate limit is capped at a maximum of 70 requests per second.

    description: >
      CoinPayments API uses SHA-256 which is a way of authenticating an API
      request to ensure that it comes from a trusted source.

      In this scheme, the API server generates a unique signature for each
      request using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.

      ## Generate API Signature

      In order to properly sign an authenticated request for the CoinPayments v2
      API, the following headers must be included:


      * `X-CoinPayments-Client`

      * `X-CoinPayments-Timestamp`

      * `X-CoinPayments-Signature`


      The following sections are instructions for properly populating these
      headers.


      ---


      ### X-CoinPayments-Client

      Populate this header with your **CLIENT ID**


      Example value

      `cc7caaa431d54ad6accfd28b20170ee4`



      ---

      ### X-CoinPayments-Timestamp

      Before we Populate this header with the current time as a UNIX timestamp,
      exclude the milliseconds epoch, example:


      ```javascript

      const date = new Date().toISOString().split(".")[0];

      ```


      Example value:

      `2022-12-19T19:27:04`

      ---

      ### Construct the request queryString

      To create an API signature, you first need to construct the query string
      which is made of the

      following attributes concatenated together

      * method

      * url

      * clientId

      * date


      Example ( Javascript )

      ```javascript

      const queryString =
      `\ufeff${method}${url}${clientId}${date}${JSON.stringify(requestPayload)}`;

      ```


      For requests with no request body, replace last attribute by an empty
      string:

      Example ( Javascript )

      ```javascript

      const queryString = `\ufeff${method}${url}${clientId}${''}`;

      ```


      ---

      ### X-CoinPayments-Signature

      Next step is to use your `clientSecret` to generate the signature using
      SHA-256 encryption algorithm as follows:


      ```javascript

      const hash = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(queryString,
      CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(clientSecret));

      const signature = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(hash);

      ```

      Example value:

      `oW7d1ktvK7R6741oACgVR3bysGTPY8tqren0WTmmEk0=`


      ---

      Here is a complete example of how to generate an API signature for making
      a call to the create wallet API:

      ```javascript

      const clientId = 'd0ccc52b8204460783d375e278082de2';

      const clientSecret = 'WYEB+hN+89waO76QeO9T7IIqhdo/60GHrdYu2vEa7Tg=';

      const url = `https://api.coinpayments.net/api/v1/merchant/wallets`;

      const method = 'POST';

      const date = new Date().toISOString().split('.')[0];


      const createWalletDto = {
        currencyId: 2,
        label: 'Online Shop Wallet',
        webhookUrl: 'https://mysite.com/api/v1/payment/notification',
      };


      const queryString =
      `\ufeff${method}${url}${clientId}${date}${JSON.stringify(createWalletDto)}`;



      const hash = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(queryString,
      CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(clientSecret));

      const signature = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(hash);


      const headers = {
        'X-CoinPayments-Client': clientId,
        'X-CoinPayments-Timestamp': date,
        'X-CoinPayments-Signature': signature,
      };



      /** Make API call using axios ( you may choose any http client ) */

      const axiosoptions = {
        url,
        headers,
        method,
        data: createWalletDto,
      };


      const response = await this.httpsService.request(options).toPromise();

      console.log(response);

      ```

  - name: Invoices API
    description: >-
      CoinPayments exposes invoices API endpoints allowing merchants to
      implement a payment gateway on their platform and let 

      buyers pay for goods and services in cryptocurrencies supported by the
      merchant’s platform.

      With CoinPayments invoices API you may:
       - send out invoices to their clients.
       - launch an integrated hosted checkout to merchant’s payment flow that will be acting on the whitelabeling basis.
      CoinPayment’s invoices API is built around “invoice” entity. In other
      words, under the hood it generates an invoice with

      all the buyer’s and merchant’s data plus information on the
      product/service. Thus, merchant’s will be flexible in 

      managing payments with the help of this data via a set of available
      endpoints.

      Below you will find information on how payment flow is organized for each
      of the above-mentioned approaches.


      **Payment Flow for Sent out Invoices**


      Imagine a case where you have a platform that provides services on
      subscription basis. Every month you need to send out 

      invoices to your users with the reminder to pay for the subscription. In
      order to automate this flow, you may want to 

      use CoinPayments API. Here are the steps that should take place in order
      payment could occur:


      1. Merchant adds details on services for which invoice is issued,
      indicates user’s details like name, payment address 

      and email

      2. With the help of Create Invoice endpoint merchant generates an invoice
      entity with the data from step 1 and launches 

      the payment flow

      3. As a response to the Create Invoice endpoint, merchant receives all
      invoice entity data including:
       - paymentId to get payment address and check payment status
       - link to the invoice document with the active payment button that would lead user to payment checkout
       - date when invoice expires
       - array of allowed currencies with currency description, payment amount and fees.

      4. Link to the invoice is sent to the user’s email address

      5. User selects currency for payment, which triggers the Get Payment
      Address endpoint and merchant receives payment 

      address

      6. After that merchant can check the status of the payment with the help
      of Get Payment Status endpoint that includes:
       - status of payment
       - how much was detected and confirmed on blockchain
       - how much was detected but not confirmed yet.

      **Payment Flow for Integrated Checkout with Whitelabeling**


      Imagine a case where you have an online shop and you want to accept
      payment for goods in cryptocurrency. With 

      CoinPayments API you will be able to allow buyers to add goods to the
      shopping cart, click “pay” and they will be 

      forwarded to the payment gateway provided by CoinPayments. Here are the
      steps that should take place in order payment 

      could occur:


      1. Buyer selects product/service on the merchant’s site.

      2. With the help of Create Invoice endpoint merchant generates an invoice
      entity and launches the payment flow.

      3. As a response to the Create Invoice endpoint, merchant receives all
      invoice entity data including:
       - paymentId to get payment address and check payment status
       - link to the checkout for payment
       - date when invoice expires
       - array of allowed currencies with currency description, payment amount and fees.
      4. Once buyer clicks “Pay” in your website, they are forwarded to the
      CoinPayments checkout window where they select 

      currency for payment. This triggers the Get Payment Address endpoint and
      merchant receives payment address

      5. After that merchant can check the status of the payment with the help
      of Get Payment Status endpoint that includes:
       - status of payment
       - how much was detected and confirmed on blockchain
       - how much was detected but not confirmed yet.

      Below we will provide you with the detailed information on each of the
      invoices endpoints and their field values. 

      Although endpoints are the same for both described use-cases, there exists
      a slight difference in fields to be used for 

      either flow which will be addressed additionally.
  - name: Wallets API
    description: >+
      The Wallets API enables merchants to create and manage their wallets and
      wallet addresses. This is made possible through a set of endpoints that
      enable merchants to create new wallets with the coins supported by the
      platform, as well as initiate withdrawal requests from their wallets to
      any external or internal address of their choosing. With this powerful
      functionality, merchants have full control and flexibility in managing
      their cryptocurrency wallets to cater to their specific business needs.



      **Important Note:**


      If WebhookUrl field of the body is specified, then the following requests
      will be sent to the provided URL (maximum 5 attempts with 5-seconds
      timeout for a single request and 1-second delay between retries). All keys
      and values of the webhook payloads are strings. Samples of data being
      sent:


      1- When wallet is activated:

      ```javascript

      {
        "eventType" : "walletActivated",
        "walletId" : "58f78b24-1de0-42b3-9a48-94f3e9c57752",
        "walletAddress" : "0x063c9743195f53c85c8ebbdaa5916da3502b24ac"
      }

      ```




      2- When funds are received (amount is in currency's smallest units):

      ```javascript

      {
        "eventType" : "transferReceived",
        "walletId" : "58f78b24-1de0-42b3-9a48-94f3e9c57752",
        "currencyId" : "4",
        "transactionId" : "f8ea1354-b3c9-470f-af09-c2ba96f2e391" ,
        "amount" : "1000000000000000000"
      }

      ```




      3- When sent transaction is confirmed:

      ```javascript

      {
        "eventType" : "transferConfirmed",
        "fromWalletId" : "58f78b24-1de0-42b3-9a48-94f3e9c57752",
        "transactionId" : "f8ea1354-b3c9-470f-af09-c2ba96f2e391",
        "spendRequestId" : "c25bb620-ffdd-4b63-9ae6-dd8f2645c8f6",
        "txHash" : "0xdb247c2d1db3ee09658bced93761360e24d8fe555b79661f252470305babfd3d",
        "block" : "11286611"
      }

      ```

  - name: Webhooks API
    description: >-
      CoinPayments API offers webhook notifications, a powerful feature that
      allows merchants to seamlessly enable and manage notifications sent from
      CoinPayments API to their own merchant API when specific events occur.
      This provides merchants with real-time updates on important activities
      within their CoinPayments account.


      To set up webhook notifications, merchants can easily define a public
      endpoint URL on their server API and specify the events for which they
      want to receive notifications. Currently, CoinPayments supports webhook
      notifications for invoices, with plans to extend support to merchant
      wallets in the future.


      It's important to note that webhooks are tied to integration clients, and
      merchants can create multiple clients under their main account on the
      CoinPayments website, providing flexibility and customization options.


      Here is a list of invoice events for which merchants can choose to receive
      notifications:


      - **invoiceCreated:** triggered when a new invoice is created

      - **invoicePending:** triggered when an invoice is pending payment

      - **invoicePaid:** triggered when an invoice is successfully paid, a paid
      invoice means the funds are received in the seller or merchant's wallet,
      however the transaction is not yet settled or confirmed on the blockchain.

      - **invoiceCompleted:** triggered when the invoice is paid **and** the
      transaction has aquired the minimum confirmations required to mark it
      confirmed. only when an invoice is marked `Completed`, users are free to
      use the funds.

      - **invoiceCancelled:** triggered when an invoice is cancelled


      Merchants have the flexibility to create webhooks either through the
      user-friendly UI or via API calls. To create a webhook through the UI,
      simply follow these steps:


      - Access the dashboard and click on "Integrations" in the left sidebar.

      - Choose "API integrations", click "Add New", and provide a name for your
      integration client, along with your server URL.

      - On the right side of the popup screen, open the dropdown menu to specify
      the events for which you wan- to receive notifications.

      - Click "OK" to confirm your selections.


      Once completed, your webhook notifications are all set, and your API will
      receive notifications based on the events you have chosen. This allows you
      to stay updated in real-time on the activities that matter most to your
      business.


      Notification Payload will include the event type, timestamp of the invoice
      status update, and the actual invoice object


      </br>

      </br>

      Below is a descriptive flowchart illustrating the process of webhook
      notifications. This example specifically focuses on the scenario where the
      client intends for their server API to receive notifications upon invoice 
      completion

      description: >
        The Spend Request API allows users to initiate a withdrawal or a
        conversion transaction, both features follow a two-step process:


        1- **Send spend request**: This request will trigger a response
        containing a preview of the transaction,

        including any applicable fees. The purpose of this step is to allow
        users to review and verify the information provided,

        including the amount and any associated fees before proceeding.


        2- **Confirm spending funds**: the confirm spending funds endpoint is
        used to confirm spending funds from the merchant wallet, or to confirm
        converting funds, it is used to trigger publishing the transaction on
        the blockchain.



        Note: The "spendRequestId" is included in the response from the first
        step.
