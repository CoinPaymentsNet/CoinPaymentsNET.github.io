    # Common API Errors

    This section provides an overview of the common errors that you may
    encounter when utilizing CoinPayment API. By familiarizing yourself with
    these errors, you will be better equipped to handle potential issues and
    troubleshoot effectively. Understanding these errors will contribute to a
    smoother integration process and ensure a more seamless payment experience
    for your users.


    ### Unauthorized

    This error occurs when an invalid `clientId` or `clientSecret` is used to
    generate API signature to authenticate requests. It may also occur if a
    `clientId` is valid but the integration is either deleted or the user's
    account does not exist. or an invalid or incorrect client secret is
    provided. In such cases, the API returns an "Unauthorized" error.


    ### Insufficient Funds

    This error can occur in different scenarios, such as during withdrawal to an
    external address or when converting a coin to another, whether to an
    internal or external address. It arises when the user's wallet does not have
    enough balance to cover the requested transaction amount.


    ### Invalid Address

    When sending a request to create a withdrawal or a conversion, if the
    provided address is not valid or formatted incorrectly, this error is
    triggered. Users should double-check the address they provided and ensure it
    follows the required format. here are examples of Valid addresses



    #### Valid UTXO-Based Coin Addresses:

    - Bitcoin (BTC): `1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2`

    - Bitcoin Cash (BCH):
    `bitcoincash:qr7uq7uvujmzhcv29tw92q0hs7fwpht4fvl4a4kj9a`

    - Litecoin (LTC): `LZx9pzGfH6mKSzVsJZnryeVrRzt6X8uZ9r`


    #### Valid Token Coin Addresses:

    - Ethereum (ETH): `0x7E5F4552091A69125d5DfCb7b8C2659029395Bdf`

    - ERC-20 Tokens (e.g., DAI, USDT):
    `0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F`



    ### Invalid or Unsupported Currency:

    This error occurs when the requested invoice, withdrawal, conversion
    involves an invalid or unsupported currency. It could be due to the currency
    not being listed or supported on the platform. Users can utilize the
    currencies API included in the documentation to list all supported
    currencies and verify if their intended currency is supported before
    initiating the transaction.


    ### Bad request (Input validation errors):

    This error occurs when there are issues with the validation of fields in the
    request's payload. For example, if a required field is not sent, or if the
    fields have invalid values or incorrect types. The API response for a
    validation error includes a description of the error and may provide details
    about the missing fields or the specific issues with the payload.

      CoinPayments API uses SHA-256 which is a way of authenticating an API
      request to ensure that it comes from a trusted source.

      In this scheme, the API server generates a unique signature for each
      request using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.



      #### Prerequisites

      To Integrate Coin Payments API you need to obtain CLIENT ID and CLIENT
      SECRET.

      ## Generate API Signature

      In order to properly sign an authenticated request for the CoinPayments v2
      API, the following headers must be included:


      * `X-CoinPayments-Client`

      * `X-CoinPayments-Timestamp`

      * `X-CoinPayments-Signature`


      The following sections are instructions for properly populating these
      headers.


      ---


      ### X-CoinPayments-Client

      Populate this header with your **CLIENT ID**


      Example Value

      `cc7caaa431d54ad6accfd28b20170ee4`



      ---

      ### X-CoinPayments-Timestamp

      Before we Populate this header with the current time as a UNIX timestamp,
      exclude the milliseconds epoch, example:


      ```javascript

      const date = new Date().toISOString().split(".")[0];

      ```


      Example value:

      `2022-12-19T19:27:04`

      ---

      ### Construct the request queryString

      To create an API signature takes a query string you first need to
      construct the query string which is made of the

      following attributes concatenated together

      * method

      * url

      * clientId

      * date


      Example ( Javascript )

      ```javascript

      const queryString =
      `\ufeff${method}${url}${clientId}${JSON.stringify(requestPayload)}`;

      ```


      For requests with no request body, replace last attribute by an empty
      string:

      Example ( Javascript )

      ```javascript

      const queryString = `\ufeff${method}${url}${clientId}${''}`;

      ```


      ---

      ### X-CoinPayments-Signature

      Next step is to use the your `clientSecret` to generate the signature
      using SHA-256 encryption Algorithm as follows:


      ```javascript

      const hash = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(queryString,
      CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(clientSecret));

      const signature = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(hash);

      ```

      example value:

      `oW7d1ktvK7R6741oACgVR3bysGTPY8tqren0WTmmEk0=`


      ---

      Here is a complete example of how to generate an API signature for making
      a call to the create wallet API:

      ```javascript

      const clientId = 'd0ccc52b8204460783d375e278082de2';

      const clientSecret = 'WYEB+hN+89waO76QeO9T7IIqhdo/60GHrdYu2vEa7Tg=';

      const url = `https://api.coinpaymints.com/api/v1/merchant/wallets`;

      const method = 'POST';

      const date = new Date().toISOString().split('.')[0];


      const createWalletDto = {
        currencyId: 2,
        label: 'Online Shop Wallet',
        webhookUrl: 'ttps://mysite.com/api/v1/payment/notification',
      };


      const queryString =
      `\ufeff${method}${url}${clientId}${date}${JSON.stringify(createWalletDto)}`;



      const hash = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(queryString,
      CryptoJS.enc.Utf8.parse(clientSecret));

      const signature = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(hash);


      const headers = {
        'X-CoinPayments-Client': clientId,
        'X-CoinPayments-Timestamp': date,
        'X-CoinPayments-Signature': signature,
      };



      /** Make API call using axios ( you may choose any http client ) */

      const axiosoptions = {
        url,
        headers,
        method,
        data: createWalletDto,
      };


      const response = await this.httpsService.request(options).toPromise();

      console.log(response);

      ```

    description: ./paths/invoices/invoice-description
  - name: Wallets API
    description: >+
      The Wallets API enables merchants to create and manage their wallets and
      wallet addresses. This is made possible through a set of endpoints that
      enable merchants to create new wallets with the coins supported by the
      platform, as well as initiate withdrawal requests from their wallets to
      any external or internal address of their choosing. With this powerful
      functionality, merchants have full control and flexibility in managing
      their cryptocurrency wallets to cater to their specific business needs.



      **Important Note**:


      If WebhookUrl field of the body is specified then the following requests
      will be sent to the provided URL (Maximum 5 attempts with 5 seconds
      timeout for a single request and 1 second delay between retries) All keys
      and values of the webhook payloads are strings. Samples of data being
      sent:


      1- When wallet is activated:

      ```javascript

      {
        "eventType" : "walletActivated",
        "walletId" : "58f78b24-1de0-42b3-9a48-94f3e9c57752",
        "walletAddress" : "0x063c9743195f53c85c8ebbdaa5916da3502b24ac"
      }

      ```




      2- When funds are received (amount is in currency's smallest units):

      ```javascript

      {
        "eventType" : "transferReceived",
        "walletId" : "58f78b24-1de0-42b3-9a48-94f3e9c57752",
        "currencyId" : "4",
        "transactionId" : "f8ea1354-b3c9-470f-af09-c2ba96f2e391" ,
        "amount" : "1000000000000000000"
      }

      ```




      3- When sent transaction is confirmed:

      ```javascript

      {
        "eventType" : "transferConfirmed",
        "fromWalletId" : "58f78b24-1de0-42b3-9a48-94f3e9c57752",
        "transactionId" : "f8ea1354-b3c9-470f-af09-c2ba96f2e391",
        "spendRequestId" : "c25bb620-ffdd-4b63-9ae6-dd8f2645c8f6",
        "txHash" : "0xdb247c2d1db3ee09658bced93761360e24d8fe555b79661f252470305babfd3d",
        "block" : "11286611"
      }

      ```

  - name: Webhooks API
    description: >+
      CoinPayments API offers webhook notifications, a powerful feature that
      allows merchants to seamlessly enable and manage notifications sent from
      CoinPayments API to their own merchant API when specific events occur.
      This provides merchants with real-time updates on important activities
      within their CoinPayments account.


      To set up webhook notifications, merchants can easily define a public
      endpoint URL on their server API and specify the events for which they
      want to receive notifications. Currently, CoinPayments supports webhook
      notifications for invoices, with plans to extend support to merchant
      wallets in the future.


      It's important to note that webhooks are tied to integration clients, and
      merchants can create multiple clients under their main account on the
      CoinPayments website, providing flexibility and customization options.


      Here is a list of invoice events for which merchants can choose to receive
      notifications:


      - invoiceCreated: triggered when a new invoice is created

      - invoicePending: triggered when an invoice is pending payment

      - invoicePaid: triggered when an invoice is successfully paid

      - invoiceCancelled: triggered when an invoice is cancelled


      Merchants have the flexibility to create webhooks either through the
      user-friendly UI or via API calls. To create a webhook through the UI,
      simply follow these steps:


      - Access the dashboard and click on "Integrations" in the left sidebar.

      - Choose "API integrations", click "Add New", and provide a name for your
      integration client, along wit- your server URL.

      - On the right side of the popup screen, open the dropdown menu to specify
      the events for which you wan- to receive notifications.

      - Click "OK" to confirm your selections.


      Once completed, your webhook notifications are all set, and your API will
      receive notifications based on the events you have chosen. This allows you
      to stay updated in real-time on the activities that matter most to your
      business.


      Notification Payload will include the event type, timestamp of the invoice
      status update, and the actual invoice object

        CoinPayments exposes invoices API endpoints allowing merchants to create
        and send invoices

        to their clients to pay for goods and services in cryptocurrencies
        supported by the merchant's platform.


        Here are the steps for creating and paying an invoice using our payment
        system:

        1. Input the product or service name, price, and any applicable
        discounts in the corresponding fields ( see request payload below ).

        2. Specify how you want to send the invoice to the payer:

        either via email or by providing a link for them to access in their
        browser.


        **Note**: To send the invoice via email, you must set the value of the
        `isEmailDelivery` field to "true" and populate the `emailAddress` field.
        If the payer prefer to create the invoice and send the link manually through
        your preferred method,

        set the value of `isEmailDelivery` to "false" and leave the
        `emailAddress` field blank.


        3. Upon accessing the invoice link, the payer can review the bill
        details and click on the payment button to proceed to the checkout page.

        4. On the checkout page, the payer can choose or specify the preferred
        payment coin from the list of available currencies.

        Please note that only coins supported by CoinPayments and enabled by the
        merchant are available for selection.

        5. Review the wallet address and QR code provided, then use them to
        complete the payment using your selected coin.

        6. Once the payment has been successfully processed, the invoice will be
        marked as paid.

      description: >-
        The Spend Request API allows users to initiate a withdrawal or a
        conversion transaction, both features follow a two-step process:


        1- **Send spend request**: This request will trigger a response
        containing a preview of the transaction,

        including any applicable fees. The purpose of this step is to allow
        users to review and verify the information provided,

        including the amount and any associated fees before proceeding.


        2- **Confirm spending funds**: the confirm spending funds endpoint is
        used to confirm spending funds from the merchant wallet, or to confirm
        converting funds, it is used to trigger publishing the transaction on
        the blockchain.

        Note: The "spendRequestId" included in the response from the first step.

            This parameter represents the monetary value as an integer in the

            divided into 8 decimal places,

            with each division known as a Satoshi. Therefore, 1 BTC would have a
            value of 100,000,000 Satoshis, and 0.00031 BTC would have a value of
            31,000 Satoshis. Similarly,

            This parameter represents the monetary value as an integer in the
            base (smallest) unit of the currency. For instance, Bitcoin can be
            divided into 8 decimal places,

            with each division known as a Satoshi. Therefore, 1 BTC would have a
            value of 100,000,000 Satoshis, and 0.00031 BTC would have a value of
            31,000 Satoshis. Similarly,

            an amount of $9.99 USD would be represented as 999 cents. In the
            case of zero-decimal currencies like the Yen, a value of ¬•500 would
            be represented as 500.

            (e.g., Satoshis for Bitcoin).

            It allows for precise and detailed transactions by specifying the
            amount in the smallest possible denomination.

            This approach enables you to send fractional amounts of the currency
            accurately.
